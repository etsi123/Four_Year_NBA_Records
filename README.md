"There is winning and there is misery" - Bill Parcells

"Back in my day, XXX was better than this YYY". *Collective groan from all millenials*. Without exaggeration, I think that it is fair to say that we have all heard a phrase of this sort at least once in our lives. Some older person perhaps being nostalgic over some of their great memories that they need to diminish the present. Personally, this line comes up most frequently as it pertains to music and basketball and while I don't necessarily disagree with the music point, I whole-heartedly disagree as it pertains to basketball. 

To prove this, I computed 4 year NBA record for every NBA team since the 1970 season. If we sort in descending order or plot a distribution, we can see one team emerge as the best team. The mid 2010's Golden State Warriors accumulated 265 wins and won 3 of 4 NBA championships (and came within 4 points of winning 4 of 4). This is 14 more wins than the second highest. Relative to their competition, no NBA team has ever been as dominant as the mid 2010s Golden State Warriors. Note, this is not solely because of the addition of Kevin Durant. The warriors won the 2015 championship and won the most games in a regular season (73) prior to acquiring Durant and solidifying themselves as a nearly invincible juggernaut. 



One of the great present day NBA basketball debates is who is the greatest basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan or LeBron James? Even for objective, basktball pundits this isn't an easy question as it often comes down to which factors one values more than the other. If we look at accomplishments to answer the question, Jordan won 6 championships, 5 league MVPs, 10 scoring titles, and 1 defensive player of the year award (DPOY). On the other hand, LeBron James has only won 4 championships, 4 league MVPs, 1 scoring title and 0 DPOYs. Clearly, Michael Jordan is the more accomplished NBA basketball player. However, the reason this doesn't necessarily translate to the greatest NBA player of all time is that it is completely devoid of all context. Was the level of the competition that Jordan faced the same as that of LeBrons? Were their teammates of the same caliber? 










Amongst reasonable, unbiased people, there often isn't an easy way to answer this question. Some look to accomplishments to answer the question: Jordan had 6 championships and 5 league MVPs while LeBron only has 4 championships and 4 league MVPs to his name. 

Every NBA season, 30 teams play 82 games in hopes of winning as many regular season games as possible, enter the playoffs, and ultimately advance through the playoffs and win the chamnpionship. For some teams, their fans just hope to see improvement. For others, fans hope for sustained greatness. What are the drivers for sustained greatness? What brings eras to an end? We hope to understand this with a simple analysis of 


At the end of every NBA season, the performance of a team can be evaluated in 2 primary ways. 
1. Did the team exceed, meet, or fall short of expectations in the playoffs? 
2. Did the team exceed, meet or fall short of expectations during the regular season.
